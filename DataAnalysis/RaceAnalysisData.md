# Race Analysis Data
This Journal is all details and conclusions specifically regarding the analysis in the file RaceAnalysisData.xlsx. To get the most out of reading this, you'll need to have seen my analysis in this file.

### Conclusions
Based on the analysis I have done so far, I have concluded the following:
  * Between quadratic cruves and cubic curves, quadratic curves are better if there is not data on both sides of the point in time you want to generate a time for. On the other hand, cubic curves tend to be more accurate when there's data on both sides of the point in time you need a race time for.
  * A quadratic curve of best fit is ideal for extrapolating from already existing data, eg. actually predicting future times
  * A cubic curve most accurately interpolates data, eg. performing "what if" type scenarios in past races they may not have run in due to injury or other factors
  
My analysis is nowhere close to complete at the moment as right now the two finished data sets I have wildly different accuracies. Until I get more data sets completed, I cannot tell for certain if my analysis will be accurate enough to use.
