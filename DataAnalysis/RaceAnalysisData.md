# Race Analysis Data

`THIS INFORMATION AND THE ACCOMPANYING SPREADSHEET ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE AS I CHANGE MY DATA ANALYSIS METHODS`

This Journal is all details and conclusions specifically regarding the analysis in the file RaceAnalysisData.xlsx. To get the most out of reading this, you'll need to have seen my analysis in this file.

### Methods of Analysis
The following procedure was used when analyzing data in this spreadsheet:
1. All outdoor 800m data from each of the three runners was recorded in the spreadsheet.
2. The average of each runners times for each year was calculated.
3. All yearly averages were put on a scatterplot and quadratic and cubic lines of best fit were fitted to them.
4. The average of the two equations of best fit is used to generate expected times for later steps for the year before and after the data spans.
5. The data is fitted to a scatterplot one year at a time. If the first year only has one data point, I start with the first two years. Two curves of best fit one quadratic and one cubic are fitted to the data.
6. The deviation from the expected value is calculated for both the equations fo best fit for both one year before and after the final year included in the data.
7. This process repeats, adding one more year to the scatterplot until after all years in the data are included.
8. The log value (base 10) of each deviation is taken and put into a new table.
9. The average of log values for each equation for -1 and +1 year is taken.
10. The averages are run through the exponential function to reconvert into seconds.

### Conclusions
Based on the analysis I have done so far, I have concluded that quadratic curves of best fit are most suited to the data. From my analysis so far, I conclude that a quadratic curve of best fit can extrapolate a year out and be off by usually at most 1 second.
  
My analysis is only partially complete and my conclusions may change as more data gets analyzed.
