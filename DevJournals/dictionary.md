# Dictionary

I happen to use many ambiguous terms in my journals and probably quite a few in program comments. If there is a term I have not defined well in another journal or program, It's probably here.

As of January 20th 2021, here is the full list of definitions I see the need to be more clearly defined in my works:

##### Practical Time
This refers to the times generated by the statistical model I will eventually put together. Since, quite obviously, runners will never run the exact same time in every race, the algorithm puts together a rougb estimate based on previous times they have run.

##### Raw Data
Raw data is data that is both not sorted and does not have any practical times generated for any runner.

##### Analyzed Data
Analyzed data is data that has generated practical times for every runner but is not yet sorted.

##### Clean Data
Clean data is data that is both sorted and has generated practical times for every runner.

If there are any terms I have not defined clearly enough or that are not in this dictionary, please inform me and I will add them.
