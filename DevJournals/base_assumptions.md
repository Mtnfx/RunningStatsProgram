# Base Assumptions
To make viewing this project a bit easier, there are certain rules I follow as to what I post on this project and when I post it. Based on these rules, it is safe and almost certainly correct except in rare circumstances to assume the following:
  * All code posted in the repository is functional. That is to say, it will not throw any errors if run.
  * Likewise, if my comments in a file state that the last addition to a file works as intended, everything else in the file works as intended. Additionally, if my comments state that the last addition does not work as intended, you may still assume everything else in the file will unless indicated otherwise.
