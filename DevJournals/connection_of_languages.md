# Connection of Different Languages
As of January 20th 2021, I have decided to use R for processing databases. Due to this, I will outline a very broad outline of how I plan to switch between multiple languages to make my code run relatively smoothly.

As of January 20th 2021, the plan is as follows:

##### Start
###### Data Type: Raw Data
1. Process raw data in a "simple" language (I'll probably use Python unless I can find an efficient way to connect R and C++).
###### Data Type: Analyzed Data
2. Transfer data to database language (probably R) to clean.
3. Sort data ascending based on the generated practical times
###### Data Type: Clean Data
4. Merge multiple sets of clean data from different divisions together to create a new set of data (This step is only necessary if running competitions span multiple rounds)
###### Data Type: Raw Data
5. Start at the top of the algorithm and repeat for subsequent rounds of competition
##### End

While I am not going out of my way to document thoroughly, I do hope that if my journals seem unclear, someone gives any kind of feedback.
